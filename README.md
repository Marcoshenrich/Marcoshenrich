# Marcos Henrich - Software Engineer
Pronouns: he/him

<!--

Hi everyone! I am a former science teacher and marine scientist turned software engineer! I am driven by a challenge and love that software engineering allows me to learn something new every day. I really enjoy working on a team and collaborating with other engineers - I believe you learn so much more when you get a slough of diverse ideas. I am also competitive, but mostly with myself - I try to challenge myself to always be better than I was yesterday.

I am most proud of one of my Full Stack Projects, **Willow**, a clone of Zillow with thematic elements.

## Previous Careers and How They Help Me Be the Best Engineer I Can Be

  Before becoming a software engineer, I worked in a variety of careers, including: Marine Science Research and Education, Operations at Tesla, and as a High School Science Teacher and Director of Student Activities. While it is hard to pinpoint just a few things I learned at these jobs, the below is my best attempt to do so: 
  
* From **marine science**, I realized my passion for **data analysis** and how powerful numbers can be. I also realized my passion for conservation, which has allowed me to keep **Green Software Engineering** practices at the forefront of my mind always.
  
* From Tesla, I learned about the **power of technology and software** and the value of working on a **cohesive team that values each other's opinions**.
  
* From working as a science teacher, I learned how to be **adaptable and pick up new skills quickly**. 
  
 I am thrilled to be able to bring all of these experiences with me into the field of software engineering, and to be able to continue to develop these skills and gain more.

### Hobbies

When I am not busy programming, I enjoy social dancing, outdoor exploration, beach days, and playing DnD.
